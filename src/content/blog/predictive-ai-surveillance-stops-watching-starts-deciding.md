faqs:
  - question: "What is predictive policing and does it work?"
    answer: "Predictive policing uses historical crime data to forecast where crimes might occur or who might commit them. Studies have repeatedly found it reinforces existing biases — because it trains on data from over-policed neighborhoods, it predicts more crime there, leading to more policing, which generates more data confirming the prediction. It is a feedback loop, not a neutral forecast."
  - question: "What is a 'black box' AI system?"
    answer: "A black box AI is a system whose internal decision-making process cannot be inspected, explained, or audited by the people affected by its decisions. Most predictive surveillance systems are proprietary black boxes — you can be denied a job, flagged as a risk, or given a higher insurance premium without any right to know why, or to challenge the reasoning."
  - question: "What is social scoring and is it only happening in China?"
    answer: "Social scoring assigns individuals a trustworthiness or risk score based on behavioral and demographic data. While China's system is the most documented, similar mechanisms exist in Western countries through insurance risk models, credit scoring that incorporates behavioral data, employer AI screening tools, and criminal risk assessment algorithms used by courts."
  - question: "Can algorithmic decisions be appealed?"
    answer: "In most countries, there is little to no formal right to appeal an algorithmic decision, especially from private companies. The EU's GDPR provides some rights around automated decision-making, but enforcement is inconsistent. In the US, there is almost no federal protection. You may not even be told that an algorithm was involved in a decision affecting you."
  - question: "How does garbage-in-garbage-out apply to AI surveillance?"
    answer: "AI systems learn from historical data. If that data reflects biased policing, discriminatory hiring, or unequal access, the AI learns to reproduce those patterns. A system trained on arrests in over-policed areas predicts more crime there. A system trained on hiring decisions that favored certain demographics will continue to favor them. The bias is invisible because it is embedded in the data, not the code."

This is a follow-up to [How AI Is Quietly Eroding Your Privacy](/blog/how-ai-is-eroding-your-privacy/), which covers facial recognition, digital ID, data brokers, and the basics of AI surveillance. This piece goes deeper — into how these systems actually work under the hood, and what it means that they have moved from watching people to making judgments about them.

## How It Used to Work — And Why That Mattered

To understand what is changing, you need to understand the old model.

Traditional surveillance required human effort. A police department wanted to find someone? They reviewed footage manually, interviewed witnesses, put out a description. The process was slow, expensive, and bottlenecked by the number of people available to do it.

That limitation created something important: **privacy by inconvenience**. Governments and corporations could theoretically watch everyone, but practically could not. There were too many people and not enough staff. Surveillance was targeted because targeting was the only option.

AI removes that constraint entirely. And that changes the nature of the thing itself.

## How Facial Recognition Actually Learns

When a facial recognition system is built, engineers do not write rules like "if the nose is shaped like X, it is person Y." Instead they show the system millions of labeled photographs and let it find its own patterns.

The system learns to map facial geometry — the precise distance between eyes, the depth of the brow ridge, the curve of the jawline, the angle of the cheekbones — into a numerical signature called an embedding. No two people's embeddings are identical. Given a new photo, the system generates an embedding and compares it against a database of stored embeddings in milliseconds.

The result is a system that can identify thousands of faces per minute from live camera feeds, across different angles, lighting conditions, and partial obstructions. It does not follow rules. It has internalized patterns from millions of examples.

**The training data is the most important ingredient.** If the dataset is unrepresentative — too many photos of one demographic, too few of another — the system learns correspondingly biased patterns. This is not a theoretical problem. Studies have consistently shown that commercially deployed facial recognition systems have significantly higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals and women. Those errors, in a law enforcement context, mean wrongful identification. Which means wrongful arrest.

## The Shoplifting Camera: A Concrete Example

The easiest way to understand how AI surveillance has changed is through a concrete example.

How did a store handle shoplifting in 2005? Security guards. A few cameras recording to tapes. If something happened, staff reviewed the footage afterward. Cameras were mostly deterrents — passive, recording, reactive. A guard might notice someone suspicious, but they could not watch every customer simultaneously.

Here is what a modern AI-equipped retail surveillance system actually does:

You enter the store. Cameras capture your face at the entrance. The system maps your facial geometry and generates an embedding. It checks that embedding against a database — known shoplifters, watchlists, or simply a store-maintained record of previous customers. If you have shopped here before and paid by card, the system links your face to your payment identity and full purchase history in real time.

As you move through the store, the system tracks your path. It notes how long you linger in specific aisles, flags "unusual behavior" patterns, and estimates your age and apparent mood from your facial expressions. If you leave without purchasing, your visit is logged against your profile.

No guard was watching you specifically. The AI was watching everyone, simultaneously, automatically, building a file on each person present.

This is not a hypothetical. This is the current state of retail surveillance technology.

## Predictive Policing: The Feedback Loop Problem

Predictive policing is among the most consequential applications of AI surveillance, and one of the least understood by the public.

The premise sounds reasonable: analyze historical crime data to predict where crimes are likely to occur, and deploy police there in advance. In practice, the system has a fundamental flaw that makes it not just ineffective but actively harmful.

Historical crime data does not reflect where crimes occur. It reflects where police were deployed and made arrests. In over-policed neighborhoods — typically lower-income areas, communities of color — there are more arrests because there is more policing, not necessarily more crime.

When you train an AI on this data, it learns that these neighborhoods have high crime rates. It recommends more policing there. That policing generates more arrests. That arrest data is fed back into the system. The prediction becomes self-confirming.

The result is a feedback loop that encodes historical policing bias into algorithmic authority. A judge can overrule a police officer's instinct. A court can hear an appeal. An algorithm's recommendation arrives with the appearance of objectivity and the cover of mathematics — and there is rarely a meaningful way to challenge it.

## Social Scoring: Not Just China

China's social credit system is the most visible example of algorithmic social scoring — a system that combines surveillance data with financial records, online behavior, and government databases to generate a score that determines access to travel, education, and loans.

What is less understood is that equivalent mechanisms already exist in Western democracies, fragmented across the private sector.

**Insurance:** Behavioral data from apps, wearables, loyalty programs, and data brokers feeds into risk models that price health, auto, and life insurance. Your jogging habits, sleep patterns, and grocery purchases influence your premium. You are told the price. You are not shown the model.

**Credit:** Some credit scoring systems now incorporate non-financial behavioral data — social connections, spending patterns at certain types of businesses, even what neighborhood you live in. The factors are not disclosed. The score is presented as objective.

**Hiring:** AI resume screening tools are used by most large employers. These systems were trained on data reflecting historical hiring decisions — which themselves reflected historical biases. When researchers submitted identical resumes with names associated with different racial groups, callback rates differed significantly.

**Criminal sentencing:** Tools like COMPAS are used in US courts to generate risk scores predicting the likelihood of reoffending. These scores influence bail decisions and sentences. ProPublica's investigation found COMPAS was roughly twice as likely to falsely flag Black defendants as high risk compared to white defendants.

Taken individually, each of these might seem like an efficiency tool. Taken together, they constitute a social scoring infrastructure that is comprehensive, opaque, and operating without public consent.

## The Black Box Problem

Every system described above shares one critical property: **you cannot see inside it.**

These are proprietary systems. Their training data, their internal logic, and their decision criteria are trade secrets. When a system flags you — for a loan denial, a risk score, a job rejection, a travel restriction — you typically have no right to know:

- What data was used
- What factors were weighted
- What the system's known error rates are for people like you
- How to challenge the decision

In criminal justice contexts, defendants have tried to challenge algorithmic risk scores and been told the methodology is protected intellectual property. The company's commercial interest in keeping their model secret has, in some cases, been treated as superseding a defendant's right to understand the basis of their sentence.

This is the black box problem. It is not technical. It is political — a choice about whose interests the legal system protects.

## When the Algorithm Gets It Wrong

AI surveillance systems fail. The question is what happens when they do.

**They cannot understand context.** A face in a crowd at a political protest looks identical to the system as a face in a crowd at a concert. The system identifies the person. It does not know why they were there, what they believe, or what they were doing. Context is precisely what humans are good at and algorithms are not.

**Biased data produces biased outputs.** A system trained on arrests in certain neighborhoods predicts crime in those neighborhoods. A system trained on historical hiring decisions replicates those decisions. The bias is invisible because it is embedded in the data, not written as a rule. It arrives wearing the authority of mathematics.

**Errors compound.** A false facial recognition match leads to an arrest. The arrest generates a record. The record feeds into a risk assessment tool. The risk assessment influences a judge. Each step in the chain treats the previous output as fact.

By the time a person has been processed through this chain, the original error — a misidentified face from a grainy CCTV image — has become a sentence.

## The Conclusion That Matters

The shift from surveillance as documentation to surveillance as prediction and judgment is not a technical upgrade. It is a fundamental change in the relationship between individuals and the systems that govern them.

When surveillance watched and recorded, you could contest what the footage showed. When surveillance predicts and decides, you are contesting an algorithm's probability estimate — a number generated by a model you cannot inspect, trained on data you were never shown, optimized for an outcome you were never consulted on.

That is not a system of accountability. It is a system of automation — and the difference matters enormously.

Understanding that these systems exist, how they work, and where they fail is not paranoia. It is the minimum required to participate in the debate about whether this is how we want our societies to function.
