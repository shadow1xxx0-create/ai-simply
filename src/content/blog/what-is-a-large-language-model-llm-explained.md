faqs:
  - question: "What is a large language model in simple terms?"
    answer: "A large language model (LLM) is an AI trained on enormous amounts of text — books, websites, code, research papers — until it learned to read and write like a human. It works by predicting the most likely next word in any sequence, over and over, billions of times per second. That prediction engine is what produces the responses you get from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini."
  - question: "What does LLM stand for?"
    answer: "LLM stands for Large Language Model. In the AI world, 'large' refers to the massive size of both the training data (trillions of words) and the model itself (billions to trillions of internal parameters). Note: LLM also stands for 'Master of Laws' — a legal degree. If you searched for the AI version, you're in the right place."
  - question: "What is the difference between an LLM and ChatGPT?"
    answer: "LLM is the category of technology. ChatGPT is a product. The relationship is: LLM (the type of technology) → GPT-4 (OpenAI's specific model) → ChatGPT (the chat interface you use). Calling ChatGPT an LLM is like calling an iPhone a 'smartphone' — accurate, but not specific. Claude, Gemini, and Llama are also LLMs, built by different companies."
  - question: "What is the difference between LLM and GPT?"
    answer: "GPT is one specific family of large language models, made by OpenAI. LLM is the broader category. All GPT models are LLMs, but not all LLMs are GPT. Claude (by Anthropic), Gemini (by Google), and Llama (by Meta) are all LLMs that have nothing to do with GPT. Think of LLM as 'smartphone' and GPT as 'iPhone' — one is the type, the other is a specific brand."
  - question: "How does an LLM actually work?"
    answer: "An LLM works in two phases. First, training: the model reads trillions of tokens of text and adjusts billions of internal settings (called parameters) until it can accurately predict what word comes next in any sentence. Second, inference: when you type a prompt, the trained model uses those frozen settings to generate a response, one token at a time, based entirely on what's statistically likely to come next."
  - question: "What are parameters in AI, explained simply?"
    answer: "Parameters are the numerical 'settings' inside an AI model — like billions of tiny dials, each one representing a weight or connection strength. During training, each dial gets adjusted until the model predicts language accurately. GPT-3 has 175 billion of these dials. GPT-4 is estimated at around 1.8 trillion. More parameters generally means the model can capture more nuanced patterns in language, but also requires far more computing power."
  - question: "Why do LLMs make things up (hallucinate)?"
    answer: "LLMs hallucinate because they're trained to predict what sounds right, not what is factually true. They don't look up facts — they generate statistically plausible text based on patterns. When a question touches on something rare or absent in their training data, they fill the gap with something that sounds correct. An LLM has no internal way to know when it's wrong."
  - question: "What is a token in AI?"
    answer: "A token is the smallest unit an LLM processes — roughly a word-chunk or syllable. 'Cat' is 1 token. 'Unbelievable' might be 3 tokens. Punctuation and numbers are their own tokens. LLMs don't read sentences the way humans do — they break everything into tokens and predict one token at a time. Modern models process hundreds of tokens per second."
  - question: "What are the biggest LLMs in 2025 and 2026?"
    answer: "The most capable LLMs as of 2026 include OpenAI's GPT-4 (est. 1.8 trillion parameters), Meta's Llama 4 Maverick (400 billion total parameters), DeepSeek R1 (671 billion parameters, open-weight), Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Anthropic's Claude 3.5/4. Parameter counts for Google and Anthropic models are not publicly disclosed."
  - question: "Is an LLM the same as AI?"
    answer: "No — LLMs are one type of AI. AI is a broad field covering everything from recommendation algorithms to robotics. LLMs are specifically a type of deep learning model designed to process and generate human language. Generative AI (which creates text, images, audio, and video) is a sub-category of AI that includes LLMs, but LLMs are just one part of the larger AI landscape."
  - question: "Can LLMs actually understand language?"
    answer: "This is genuinely debated. LLMs can use language with impressive fluency — they follow grammar, context, and nuance better than any previous system. But whether they 'understand' in a meaningful sense is unclear. They have no experiences, no intentions, and no beliefs. What they do is pattern-match at extraordinary scale. Whether that constitutes understanding depends on how you define the word."
  - question: "What are the limitations of large language models?"
    answer: "LLMs have several real limitations: they hallucinate (confidently make things up), have a knowledge cutoff date, lack persistent memory between sessions, struggle with math and logical reasoning, are expensive to train, and consume significant energy. They also reflect biases in their training data. Understanding these limitations is essential for using LLMs effectively."

ChatGPT isn't thinking. It isn't understanding your question. And it doesn't "know" anything the way you do.

It's doing something far weirder, and arguably far more impressive.

That something is called a **large language model**, or **LLM**. It's the technology behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and virtually every AI assistant you've ever used. Over 1 billion people use products built on it every month. It powers Google searches, customer service bots, code editors, and medical diagnosis tools.

And almost nobody can explain what it actually is.

This guide fixes that. By the end, you'll understand exactly how LLMs work (not the buzzword version, the real version), including the numbers, the limitations, and what it all means for you.

## What Is a Large Language Model? (The Short Answer)

A **large language model** is an AI trained on an enormous amount of text until it learned to read and write like a human.

That's the core of it.

The "large" refers to two things: the size of the training data (trillions of words, more text than any human could read in thousands of lifetimes) and the size of the model itself (billions to trillions of internal settings called **parameters**).

The "language" part means it deals specifically in text: understanding it, generating it, summarizing it, translating it, and answering questions about it.

The "model" part means it's a mathematical system, a massive network of numbers that was trained to recognize patterns in language and reproduce them.

Here's the key insight: **an LLM doesn't look anything up.** It doesn't search a database of facts when you ask it a question. It generates a response word by word, based entirely on what's statistically likely to come next, based on patterns absorbed during training.

That's what makes it so impressive. And so unreliable.

## LLM vs. GPT vs. ChatGPT vs. Claude: What's Actually the Difference?

This is the most common source of confusion, so let's kill it immediately.

```
LLM — the TYPE of technology (like "smartphone")
  ↓
GPT / Claude / Gemini / Llama — specific MODELS (like "iPhone" or "Galaxy")
  ↓
ChatGPT / Claude.ai / Gemini.com — the PRODUCTS you actually use (like the app)
```

Here's what each term means:

**LLM (Large Language Model):** the category. Any AI trained on massive amounts of text to understand and generate language. Saying "ChatGPT uses an LLM" is like saying "your iPhone is a smartphone." True, but not specific.

**GPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) — OpenAI's specific model family. The "G" means it generates text. The "P" means it was pre-trained on huge data before you use it. The "T" means it uses the transformer architecture (more on that below). GPT-3 had 175 billion parameters. GPT-4 is estimated at ~1.8 trillion.

**ChatGPT** — the product OpenAI built on top of GPT. When you go to ChatGPT.com, you're using a chat interface powered by an underlying GPT model. ChatGPT launched in November 2022 and reached 100 million users in two months — the fastest app in history at the time. As of January 2026, it has an estimated **1 billion monthly active users**.

**Claude** — Anthropic's model and product. Founded by former OpenAI researchers. Claude 3, 3.5, and beyond. Holds roughly 32% of the enterprise AI market.

**Gemini** — Google DeepMind's LLM, formerly called Bard. Integrated into Google Search, Gmail, and Docs. Available as a standalone product at gemini.google.com.

**Llama** — Meta's open-source LLM family. Unlike the others, Llama's model weights are publicly released — meaning developers can download and run it themselves, for free. The latest, Llama 4, uses a technique called Mixture of Experts (more below).

**DeepSeek** — A Chinese AI company that released DeepSeek R1 in January 2025 — a 671-billion-parameter model that matched OpenAI's best at a fraction of the cost. Caused a significant stock market shock and forced a reevaluation of how much LLMs actually cost to build.

**The bottom line**: GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and DeepSeek are all LLMs. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and Gemini.com are the products built on top of them. LLM is just the name for the type of thing they all are.

## How Does an LLM Actually Work?

This is the part most explainers skip or get wrong. Here it is, layer by layer.

### Step 1: Training — Reading the Internet

Before an LLM can do anything useful, it has to be trained.

Training works like this: the model reads an unimaginable amount of text — books, websites, Wikipedia, academic papers, Reddit threads, code repositories, news articles — and for every sentence it reads, it tries to predict the next word. If it gets it wrong, it adjusts its internal settings slightly. Then it reads the next sentence. And the next. Trillions of times.

GPT-3 was trained on approximately **300 billion tokens** from 45 terabytes of text. Llama 3 trained on **15 trillion tokens** — roughly the equivalent of reading the entire internet multiple times. GPT-4 is estimated at **~13 trillion tokens**.

Training requires massive computing infrastructure. Training GPT-3 consumed **1,287 megawatt-hours** of electricity — enough to power around 330 American homes for a full year. For GPT-4, the energy and hardware costs ran into the tens of millions of dollars.

This is why only a handful of companies can train frontier models. It's not just hard — it's extraordinarily expensive.

### Step 2: Tokens — How AI "Reads" Text

LLMs don't read words. They read **tokens**.

A token is a chunk of text — roughly a word, a syllable, or a punctuation mark. "Cat" is one token. "Unbelievable" might be three tokens: "Un", "believ", "able." Numbers and punctuation get their own tokens too.

When you type a message to ChatGPT, your text is immediately broken into tokens before the model processes anything. The model then generates its response one token at a time — predicting the most likely next token, generating it, then predicting the next one, and so on.

GPT-4 can handle a **context window** of up to 128,000 tokens at once — that's roughly a 200-page book. Llama 4 Scout pushes this to an extraordinary **10 million tokens** — almost an entire library's worth of context in a single conversation.

### Step 3: The Transformer — The 2017 Breakthrough

Before 2017, AI language models read text sequentially — one word at a time, like a human reading slowly. This made it nearly impossible to capture long-range relationships (how a word at the start of a paragraph relates to one at the end).

In 2017, Google researchers published a paper called **"Attention Is All You Need"** that changed everything. They introduced the **transformer architecture** — a way for AI models to read all words simultaneously and weigh how much each word matters to every other word.

The "T" in GPT stands for Transformer. Every major LLM today — GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama — is built on transformer architecture. It's the single biggest technical breakthrough in AI since deep learning.

### Step 4: Attention — How Words Understand Each Other

The key innovation in the transformer is the **attention mechanism**.

Here's the intuition: read this sentence — *"The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired."*

Your brain instantly knows "it" refers to "the animal," not "the street." How? You paid *attention* to the relationship between words.

The attention mechanism does this computationally. Every word (technically every token) asks every other token: *"How important are you to understanding me?"* The model assigns a weight to each relationship — strong if the words are closely related, weak if they're not. Then it uses those weights to build a richer understanding of each token in context.

Multiple **attention heads** run in parallel, each tracking different types of relationships — grammar, meaning, long-range references, subject-verb agreement, and more.

This is what allows LLMs to hold coherent conversations, follow long instructions, and understand context in a way previous models couldn't.

### Step 5: Parameters — The Knobs Under the Hood

This is the concept that confuses people most.

A **parameter** is a single numerical value inside the model's neural network — one tiny setting among billions. Think of it as a dial. During training, all those dials are adjusted — billions of tiny increments — until the model produces accurate predictions.

Here's an analogy from algebra: `2a + b = result`. Those letters are parameters. Assign them values, and the equation produces a result. Now scale that to **175 billion variables** (GPT-3) or an estimated **1.8 trillion** (GPT-4), each fine-tuned by exposure to trillions of training examples. That's what lives inside an LLM.

More parameters generally means the model can capture more subtle, nuanced patterns in language. But it also means the model is slower, more expensive to run, and requires more hardware.

This is why the industry has been pushing toward **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** — a technique where instead of one giant model, you have many specialist sub-models, and each query gets routed to the most relevant one. Meta's Llama 4 Scout has **109 billion total parameters**, but only activates **17 billion** for any given prompt. This makes it dramatically cheaper to run without sacrificing much capability.

### Step 6: Inference — What Actually Happens When You Type a Prompt

Training is the learning phase. **Inference** is everything that happens after — when the trained model is actually used.

When you type into ChatGPT:

1. Your text is broken into tokens
2. Those tokens are fed into the model
3. The model processes them through its transformer layers, activating billions of parameters
4. It predicts the single most likely next token
5. That token is generated, appended to the context
6. The model predicts the next token
7. This repeats until the response is complete

The speed of this process is staggering. Fast models like Llama 4 Scout can process roughly **2,600 tokens per second**. Even slower frontier models like GPT-4 class systems run at **~187 tokens per second** — generating around 140 words per second. Faster than any human can read.

Unlike training (which happens once and costs millions), inference happens billions of times per day. ChatGPT processes **2 billion queries daily**.

## How Big Are These Models? The Real Numbers

Here's where things get concrete.

### Parameter Counts

| Model | Parameters | Company |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| GPT-3 | 175 billion | OpenAI (confirmed) |
| GPT-4 | ~1.8 trillion (est.) | OpenAI (not officially confirmed) |
| Llama 3 (largest) | 70 billion | Meta (confirmed) |
| Llama 4 Scout | 109B total / 17B active (MoE) | Meta (confirmed) |
| Llama 4 Maverick | 400B total / 17B active (MoE) | Meta (confirmed) |
| DeepSeek R1 | 671 billion | DeepSeek (confirmed) |
| Claude 3+ | Not disclosed | Anthropic |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | Not disclosed | Google |

Note: OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic stopped disclosing parameter counts after GPT-3 for competitive reasons. The GPT-4 1.8 trillion figure is an estimate from leaked documents, not confirmed.

### Training Data

| Model | Training Tokens | Equivalent |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| GPT-3 | ~300 billion | 45 TB of text |
| GPT-4 | ~13 trillion (est.) | Includes internet, code, books |
| Llama 3 | 15 trillion | Confirmed by Meta |
| DeepSeek R1 | ~14.8 trillion | Reported |

For reference: a single token is roughly 0.75 words. 15 trillion tokens = roughly 11.25 trillion words. All of Wikipedia in English is about 4 billion words. These models trained on amounts of text that dwarf all recorded human knowledge.

### The Market

The LLM industry is growing at an almost incomprehensible rate. In 2023, the market was worth **$4.5 billion**. By 2025, it's estimated at **$7.77–8.3 billion**. Analysts project it will reach **$149.89 billion by 2035** — a compound annual growth rate of roughly **34%**.

Total global spending on generative AI (which LLMs power) hit **$644 billion in 2025**, according to Gartner.

## Why LLMs Make Things Up: Hallucinations Explained

This is the most important limitation to understand.

LLMs [hallucinate](/blog/what-are-ai-hallucinations-why-ai-lies-to-you) — they confidently generate information that's wrong, invented, or completely fabricated.

This isn't a bug that will eventually be patched. It's a fundamental property of how these systems work.

Here's why: LLMs are trained to predict the most statistically likely next token. Not the most *true* token — the most *likely* one, based on patterns in training data. When the training data covers a topic well, the predictions tend to be accurate. When it doesn't — niche topics, rare events, very specific facts — the model generates something that *sounds* like the right answer even when it isn't.

A 2024 arXiv paper titled *"Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models"* makes the argument plainly: LLMs cannot learn all computable functions, and will hallucinate if used as general problem-solvers. The math doesn't allow for a perfect fix.

Real consequences are already piling up. In Australia in 2025, Deloitte submitted a **$440,000 government report** containing non-existent academic citations and a fake federal court quote — generated by AI. In the US, **Air Canada's chatbot invented a bereavement refund policy** that didn't exist, and a court ordered Air Canada to honor it. US courts are now seeing **two to three AI hallucination cases per day**.

The best models have dramatically reduced (not eliminated) hallucinations. On simple summarization tasks, top models hallucinate as rarely as **0.7%** of the time. On harder tasks like legal questions, rates jump to **18.7%**. The average across all models and tasks sits around **9.2%** — roughly one in eleven answers contains fabricated information.

The practical implication: never trust AI output for high-stakes decisions without verification. Use AI to draft, explore, and understand — not as the final authority on facts.

## What Are LLMs Used For?

LLMs are the engine behind an enormous range of products and tasks.

**Writing and editing:** drafting emails, articles, marketing copy, legal documents, code comments. The single most common use case, used by **57% of knowledge workers** for productivity tasks.

**Code generation:** tools like GitHub Copilot (used by over 1.8 million developers) use LLMs to suggest code in real time. LLMs trained on code repositories can write, debug, and explain code across dozens of programming languages — and have made [vibe coding](/blog/what-is-vibe-coding-explained) (building apps in plain English) accessible to non-developers.

**Research and summarization:** feeding in long documents and getting structured summaries. **51.7% of knowledge workers** use LLMs for research tasks.

**Customer service:** most modern chatbots are powered by fine-tuned LLMs rather than the rigid rule-based systems of the past.

**Search:** Google's AI Overviews, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot all use LLMs to generate search summaries and direct answers.

**Translation:** DeepL, Google Translate, and similar tools now use LLM-based approaches that dramatically outperform older machine translation systems.

**Education:** explaining concepts, tutoring, generating practice problems, providing feedback on writing.

**[AI agents](/blog/what-is-an-ai-agent-explained-simply):** LLMs are the reasoning engine inside autonomous AI agents that can browse the web, write code, and take multi-step actions to complete complex tasks.

## The Biggest LLMs in 2026 — How They Compare

| Model | Company | Type | Standout Feature |
|-------|---------|------|-----------------|
| GPT-4 / GPT-5 | OpenAI | Closed | Most widely used; 1B+ ChatGPT users |
| Claude 3.5 / 4 | Anthropic | Closed | Strong reasoning; preferred in enterprise (32% market share) |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | Google | Closed | Deepest Google integration; strong at multimodal tasks |
| Llama 4 Scout / Maverick | Meta | Open-source | Free to download; 10M token context window |
| DeepSeek R1 | DeepSeek | Open-weight | 671B parameters; matches GPT-4 class at a fraction of the cost |
| Mistral | Mistral AI | Open-weight | Efficient European alternative; strong for on-device use |

**Open-source vs. closed** is one of the defining tensions in the LLM world right now. Closed models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) are more polished and safer but controlled by corporations. Open models (Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek) can be run privately, customized, and studied — but require more technical setup and carry safety risks.

The [generative AI landscape](/blog/what-is-generative-ai) is shifting fast: DeepSeek's January 2025 release showed that powerful models could be built for a fraction of what US companies were spending, upending assumptions about who controls cutting-edge AI.

## What Are the Limits of Large Language Models?

Understanding what LLMs can't do is just as important as knowing what they can.

**Knowledge cutoff:** LLMs don't browse the internet in real time (unless given specific tools). Their knowledge stops at a training cutoff date. Ask about events after that date and the model will either refuse or hallucinate.

**No true memory:** By default, every conversation starts fresh. The model doesn't remember you, your preferences, or past sessions. Context exists only within a single conversation.

**Poor at math:** LLMs predict tokens. They don't calculate. They often get arithmetic wrong on anything more complex than simple addition. This is why tools like ChatGPT now integrate external calculators and code execution.

**Energy and cost:** Training frontier models costs tens of millions of dollars. Running them at scale consumes enormous energy. Projected AI energy demand could reach **85–134 terawatt-hours annually by 2027**, comparable to the Netherlands' entire energy consumption.

**Bias:** LLMs learn from human-generated text. Human text contains biases. Those biases are absorbed and reproduced, sometimes subtly, sometimes not.

**Can't truly reason:** LLMs are excellent at *appearing* to reason. Newer models with chain-of-thought capabilities — known as [AI reasoning models](/blog/what-is-an-ai-reasoning-model-explained) like OpenAI's o-series and Claude's extended thinking — have improved dramatically. But there's an ongoing debate about whether this is genuine logical reasoning or extremely sophisticated pattern matching.

**Size vs. efficiency tradeoff:** Bigger models are generally more capable but slower and more expensive. The Mixture of Experts approach (used in Llama 4 and GPT-4) tries to get the best of both by only activating part of the model at a time.

## How Much Does It Cost to Use an LLM?

For developers accessing LLMs via API (building apps and products), pricing is per **million tokens** processed.

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| GPT-5 nano (cheapest) | $0.05 | $0.40 |
| GPT-4o mini | $0.15 | $0.60 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.50 | $3.00 |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | $1.25 | $10.00 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | $3.00 | $15.00 |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $5.00 | $25.00 |

The cheapest option ($0.05 per million input tokens) lets you process roughly **750,000 words** for five cents. The most expensive is **500 times pricier** but delivers the most capable responses. For consumer use (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Gemini Advanced), most products charge $20/month for unlimited or high-volume access to mid-tier models.

## Is an LLM the Same as AI?

No. LLMs are one type of AI.

**AI** is a broad field covering any system that performs tasks that normally require human intelligence — from chess engines to spam filters to recommendation algorithms.

**[Machine learning](/blog/what-is-machine-learning-explained)** is a subset of AI where systems learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.

**Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning using neural networks with many layers.

**Generative AI** is a subset of deep learning that creates new content — text, images, audio, video.

**LLMs** are a subset of generative AI focused specifically on language.

So: LLM → Generative AI → Deep Learning → Machine Learning → AI.

When people talk about "AI" in 2026, they usually mean LLM-powered products. But the term is much broader. Understanding where LLMs fit helps you understand [what generative AI actually is](/blog/what-is-generative-ai) — and what it isn't.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Wait — doesn't LLM also mean "Master of Laws"?**

Yes. LLM is also the abbreviation for *Legum Magister*, a postgraduate law degree. If you searched for this article looking for the AI version, you're in the right place. If you're looking for the law degree: wrong article, but fair confusion.

**Is AI conscious or sentient?**

No. And this is important to be clear on. LLMs have no awareness, experiences, or intentions. They generate text that *sounds* like a thinking being because they were trained on text written by thinking beings. The appearance of understanding is a reflection of the data, not evidence of an inner life. Whether future AI systems could be conscious is a genuinely open philosophical question — but current LLMs are not.

**Can I run an LLM on my own computer?**

Yes, if you use an open-source model and have a decent GPU. Meta's Llama 3 (8B parameter version) runs on a modern gaming PC. Tools like Ollama make this surprisingly accessible. The trade-off: open models are less capable than frontier closed models, and the setup requires some technical comfort.

**Will LLMs replace search engines?**

They're changing search more than replacing it. Google, Microsoft Bing, Perplexity, and others now use LLMs to generate direct answers within search results. But traditional search (finding and linking to specific web pages) still exists alongside AI-generated summaries. The risk: if people stop clicking through to original sources, the web's content economy gets disrupted — which could reduce the quality of future LLM training data. A fascinating feedback loop to watch.

## The Bottom Line

A large language model is an AI trained on trillions of words of human text until it learned to read and write with remarkable fluency. It works by predicting the next token in a sequence — billions of times per second — using a transformer architecture with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters learned during training.

GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama are all LLMs. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and Gemini.com are the products built on top of them. The market is growing at 34% per year toward a projected $149 billion by 2035. And right now, more than 1 billion people use LLM-powered products every month.

They're powerful, genuinely impressive, and deeply limited. They hallucinate. They can't truly reason. They don't remember you. But they've already changed how people write, code, search, and learn — and that's only going to accelerate.

Understanding what LLMs actually are — not the hype, not the fear, just the mechanics — is one of the most useful things you can know right now.
